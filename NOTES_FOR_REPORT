[NOTES]
- increasing the number of offspring while reducing the number of max brains puts a higher dependancy on the top brain to lead the genetic evolution path
- likewise, it allows for more stability as the top performing brain will have higher number of offspring, allowing for higher preservation of sucessfull innovations
- likewise, it also means the population evolution is less unstable as the top brain is allowed to have more brains

- increasing the population count allows for a higher number of mutations per generation whilst keeping stable
- this results in faster convergence
- keeping the first low means a very unstable evolution and keeping the second low means a very slow/inneficient evolution

- a high number of starting individuals ensures a rich environment for the top brain to evolve
- ensure a sufficient number of first gen individuals controls to some extent how fast and how long the population will evolve
